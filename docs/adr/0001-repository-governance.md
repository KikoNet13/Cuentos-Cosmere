# 0001 - Repository Governance and Traceability

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Context
The project is personal but needs professional operating discipline.
Unstructured notes and ad-hoc workflow reduce maintainability over time.

## Decision
Adopt a governance baseline with:
- `AGENTS.md` as execution contract
- task files under `docs/tasks/`
- short `CHANGELOG.md` with links to task details
- one commit per planned task on `main`

## Consequences
- Better traceability and repeatability.
- Slightly higher process overhead per task.
- Stronger long-term maintainability.
